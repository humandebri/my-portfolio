        <p>Hello, I&apos;m Hude. I studied architecture at university and started my career at a housing manufacturer, working in structural mechanics research and building design.</p>
        <p>While I enjoyed creating spaces in the physical world, I gradually became fascinated by the flexibility and creativity of technology. This passion led me to transition into the IT industry.</p>
        <p>Now, I work as a web developer, building applications with React, Next.js, and Python. My architectural background helps me bring thoughtful structure and design into everything I create.</p>
